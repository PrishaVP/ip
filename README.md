If you're a Java enthusiast, feel free to dig into the code and make it even better! Here’s the main method:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(MainApp.class, args);
    }
}

of the JavaDocs but ensured to carefully review whatever it suggested before adapting it for my use.
